Here's a detailed **README.md** content for your GitHub repository:

# Mood Detection Chatbot  
This project demonstrates a **Mood Detection Chatbot** that dynamically generates supportive and unique responses based on the user's mood using a **Language Model (LLM)**.  

The chatbot transitions from a traditional button-based interaction system to a more dynamic and context-aware interface, powered by **LangChain Community's Ollama** model.  

---

## Key Features  
- **LLM-Powered Responses**: Uses Ollama's LLM to provide creative and supportive responses for user moods.  
- **Interactive User Interface**: Built with **Streamlit** for a clean and user-friendly experience.  
- **Dynamic Mood Detection**: Generates unique outputs for moods like *Happy*, *Sad*, *Crying*, *Stressed*, and *Scared*.  

---

## How It Works  
1. **Input Options**: Users select their current mood from predefined options (*Happy, Sad, Crying, Stressed, Scared*).  
2. **LLM Integration**: The selected mood is sent as a prompt to the Ollama LLM, which generates a supportive response.  
3. **Dynamic Response Generation**: The response is displayed in the Streamlit app interface to reassure or uplift the user.  

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Core programming language for the chatbot.  
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the user interface.  
- **LangChain Community's Ollama LLM**: Provides natural language understanding and response generation.  

---

## Setup and Installation
